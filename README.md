# Sentinel2Indices
This QGIS plugin calculates indices and band combinations for sentinel 2 satellite images, e. g. NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), NDWI (normalized difference water index) and false colour composite.
Indices and products are inspired by following pages:
* https://www.sentinel-hub.com/develop/documentation/eo_products/Sentinel2EOproducts
* https://www.indexdatabase.de/

# TODO

1. Setup QGIS3 plugin
2. Functionality
    - Basic indices like NDVI, NDWI
    - Basic Products like False Color
    - cloud and snow mask
    - zero division
    - tiff or virtual raster
    - threshold value to get binary raster
3. Extensions
    - Give user possibility to add custom indices
    - Use other satellite imagery
